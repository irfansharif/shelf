In the years after he was named the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia, in 2015, Mohammed bin
Salman—known informally as M.B.S.—has accumulated remarkable power in the country. (He became crown
prince in 2017.) Saudi Arabia, under his de-facto leadership, embarked on a military campaign
against the Houthis in Yemen, temporarily kidnapped the Prime Minister of Lebanon, and blockaded
Qatar. Many of these actions were part of a campaign to isolate Iran, whose Supreme Leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, M.B.S. referred to in 2017 as "the new Hitler." While conducting his
aggressive foreign policy, M.B.S. had a close ally: Mohamed bin Zayed, the President of the United
Arab Emirates. "M.B.Z. saw M.B.S. as a younger version of himself: smart, energetic, and eager to
confront enemies," Dexter Filkins [reported](https://archive.is/o/Tpb6X/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/09/a-saudi-princes-quest-to-remake-the-middle-east) for this magazine in 2018.
