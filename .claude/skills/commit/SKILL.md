## Commit Skill
1. Run `git diff --staged` and `git diff` to see what's staged vs unstaged
2. Ask the user what to commit if unclear
3. Only stage files directly related to the task
4. Write a concise conventional commit message
5. After committing, run `git diff --staged` to confirm nothing extra was included
